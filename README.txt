Welcome to Interface + ToolKit!
It is a stupid talking code which reads off a dictionary. It is a terribly written peice of code and is very badly built. Occasionaly however, you can use it for the small ciphers or stupid games in it.
This was the set of all the code I wrote in 2014-15. All development has been stopped since. 
In the future, I hope to build another code similiar to this.
Cheers, CH
