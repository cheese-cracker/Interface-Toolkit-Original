### Interface+ToolKit
Welcome to Interface+ToolKit !<br>
It is a stupid talking code which reads off a dictionary. It is a **terribly written peice of code** and is very badly built. Occasionaly however, you can use it for the small ciphers or stupid games in it. Most of the core funtions of this code was written in **Summer 2014**. This code was updated and other functions were added till the end of Summer 2015 and minor fixes later on. Simple parts like SEO, took lots of time back then. It was originally called UserSourceTool which used Humanity dictionary(also included).<br>
#### **NOTE: All development for this code has been STOPPED since 2016 !** 
In the future, I hope to build another code similiar to this.<br>
##### Cheers, CH
